The tail of a giant wallaby is attached by a giant rubber band to a stake in the ground.
A flea is sitting on top of the stake eyeing the wallaby (hungrily). The wallaby sees the flea leaps into the air and lands one mile from the stake (with its tail still attached to the stake by the rubber band). The flea does not give up the chase but leaps into the air and lands on the stretched rubber band one inch from the stake. The giant wallaby, seeing this, again leaps into the air and lands another mile from the stake (i.e., a total of two miles from the stake). The flea is undaunted and leaps into the air again, landing on the rubber band one inch further along. Once again the giant wallaby jumps another mile. The flea again leaps bravely into the air and lands another inch along the rubber band. If this continues indefinitely, will the flea ever catch the wallaby? (Assume the earth is flat and continues indefinitely in all directions.)

Answer: 
The flea can catch up with the wallaby. 
Because every time the wallaby jump, the rubber band stretches, which made the percentage of it behind the flea also stretches. So the percentage of the rubber band the flea has covered does not change because of the wallaby jump, but it increases when the flea jumps.

We can also give the formula to express the progress:
1 mile = 63360 inches, 
let's say p[n] represents the percentage the flea covered after n jumps.
After the first jump of the flea, p[0] = 1 / 63360.
Now the wallaby jumps, but p remains. So when the flea jumps next time, it covers an additional 1 / (63360 * 2) percentage. So
p[1] = p[0] + 1 / (63360 * 2)
Similarly
p[n] = p[n - 1] + 1 / (63360* n) 
= 1 / 63360 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n)
The sum in the brackets is the partial sum of the Harmonic series which diverges. So eventually the sum will exceed 63360, and the flea will catch the wallaby then!
